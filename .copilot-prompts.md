# AI Development Prompts for Jaimish S. Lakhani Portfolio

## Context Setting Prompt
```
You are working on a modern React portfolio website called "Jaimish S. Lakhani Portfolio". This is a professional developer portfolio with multiple themed pages showcasing different aspects of a developer's skills and experience.

TECH STACK:
- React 18.2.0 with functional components and hooks
- Vite 5.0.0 for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.6 for styling with custom color palette
- React Router Dom 6.0.2 for routing
- Framer Motion 10.16.4 for animations
- Lucide React for icons
- Recharts & D3 for data visualization

ARCHITECTURE:
- Component-based architecture
- Feature-specific page organization
- Reusable UI components in src/components/
- Page-specific components in src/pages/[page-name]/components/
- Custom Tailwind color scheme based on slate palette
```

## Feature Development Prompt
```
When adding new features to this portfolio:

1. STRUCTURE: Follow the existing page/component pattern
2. STYLING: Use the custom Tailwind color palette (primary, secondary, accent variants)
3. ROUTING: Add routes to src/Routes.jsx following the kebab-case pattern
4. RESPONSIVENESS: Mobile-first design with Tailwind responsive utilities
5. ANIMATIONS: Use Framer Motion for smooth transitions
6. ICONS: Use Lucide React icons consistently
7. ACCESSIBILITY: Include proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

NAMING CONVENTIONS:
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., HeroSection.jsx)
- Files: PascalCase for components, kebab-case for pages
- Routes: kebab-case (e.g., /technical-mastery-center)
- CSS: Tailwind utilities with custom color scheme
```

## Bug Fixing Prompt
```
When fixing bugs in this React portfolio:

1. CHECK IMPORTS: Ensure proper absolute imports from src/
2. ROUTING: Verify routes are properly defined in src/Routes.jsx
3. STYLING: Check for Tailwind class conflicts or missing responsive classes
4. STATE: Look for useState/useEffect dependency issues
5. PROPS: Verify prop passing and destructuring
6. ANIMATIONS: Check Framer Motion component structure
7. BUILD: Ensure Vite build compatibility

COMMON ISSUES:
- Import path issues (use absolute imports from src/)
- Tailwind class specificity problems
- React Router path mismatches
- Framer Motion animation conflicts
- Responsive design breakpoints
```

## Code Review Prompt
```
When reviewing code for this portfolio project:

CHECKLIST:
✓ Follows component architecture pattern
✓ Uses custom Tailwind color scheme (primary-*, secondary-*, accent-*)
✓ Responsive design implemented
✓ Accessibility considerations included
✓ Proper error boundaries
✓ Performance optimizations considered
✓ Code is DRY and maintainable
✓ Follows established naming conventions
✓ Props are properly typed/validated
✓ Animations are smooth and purposeful

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Clean, readable code structure
- Consistent formatting and style
- Meaningful component and variable names
- Proper separation of concerns
- Efficient re-renders and state management
```

## Refactoring Prompt
```
When refactoring this portfolio codebase:

PRIORITIES:
1. Component reusability and DRY principles
2. Performance optimization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
3. Bundle size optimization
4. Accessibility improvements
5. Code organization and structure
6. Type safety improvements
7. Test coverage enhancement

PATTERNS TO MAINTAIN:
- Page-based component organization
- Custom Tailwind color system
- Framer Motion animation patterns
- React Router structure
- Error boundary implementation
- Responsive design approach

AVOID:
- Breaking existing component APIs
- Changing established file structure
- Removing accessibility features
- Breaking responsive layouts
- Eliminating error handling
```

## New Page Creation Prompt
```
When creating a new page for this portfolio:

TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
1. Create folder: src/pages/[page-name]/
2. Create main file: src/pages/[page-name]/index.jsx
3. Create components folder: src/pages/[page-name]/components/
4. Add route to src/Routes.jsx
5. Follow responsive design patterns
6. Include proper SEO meta tags with react-helmet
7. Implement loading states and error boundaries

PAGE COMPONENTS SHOULD INCLUDE:
- Hero/Header section
- Main content sections
- Footer/Navigation elements
- Responsive breakpoints
- Smooth animations
- Accessibility features
- Error handling
```

## Performance Optimization Prompt
```
When optimizing performance for this portfolio:

FOCUS AREAS:
1. Bundle size reduction
2. Image optimization and lazy loading
3. Component rendering optimization
4. Animation performance
5. Route-based code splitting
6. Memory leak prevention
7. SEO optimization

TOOLS & TECHNIQUES:
- React.memo for expensive components
- useMemo/useCallback for heavy computations
- Lazy loading for routes and images
- Vite bundle analysis
- Lighthouse audits
- Web vitals monitoring
- Progressive enhancement
```
